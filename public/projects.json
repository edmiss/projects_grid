","description":"We are building small robots and the accompanying software for the educational market. The aim is that the robots will set a new standard for compact and cost effective educational experiments.   \r\n\r\nA set of robots will be managed by a master system based on a Raspberry Pi, for now named &apos;god bot&apos;. This will handle multiplexing the IR communications, extracting the robot locations using it&apos;s camera and communications with the internet etc. It will also be the platform on which students will develop applications, for most uses the robots themselves can just use &apos;standard&apos; firmware. \r\n\r\nThe design methodology is to keep things cheap and simple. We want each robot to cost ~10gbp per unit at quantity, and each robot should be under 2cm square. This is to combat the price sensitivity of schools, and limited space classrooms have for multi agent robotic systems.

We&apos;re glad you asked, read on to find out more. HeartyPatch is a completely open-source wireless single-lead ECG &quot;patch&quot; which can calculate heart-rate, R-R intervals and most importantly, Heart-rate variability (HRV). Connect this data to the web of things through WiFi\/Bluetooth, or also connect to an app on your phone, and you&apos;ve got your very own, smart, cloud-connected HRV monitor. \r\n\r\nHRV is the trend at which the heart-rate, or more specifically, the time between two peaks on your ECG, changes. This change in R-R interval, and ultimately the heart-rate can mean a lot of things. For starters, it gives a good indicator of the health of your heart, one step further than just plain old heart-rate.
